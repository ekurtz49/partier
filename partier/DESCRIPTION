Description: Compares choices, i.e. political party preferences, via the cityblock metric: a theoretically superior
   method of choice comparion than the Euclidean metric, which is more widely used due to its ease of use. Many
   parties or choices can be compared on many dimensions, and their influence over all possible views on all of
   the dimensions can be seen with ease. Furthermore, the package provides visualization tools, and a function to simulate voters. 
   Appropriate data to practice with the package's functions are included.
